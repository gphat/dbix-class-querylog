=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::QueryLog - Log queries for later analysis.

=cut

our $VERSION = '1.3.2';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

DBIx::Class::QueryLog 'logs' each transaction and query executed so you can
analyze what happened in the 'session'.  It must be installed as the debugobj
in DBIx::Class:

    use DBIx::Class::QueryLog;
    use DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Analyzer;
    
    my $schema = ... # Get your schema!
    my $ql = DBIx::Class::QueryLog->new;
    $schema->storage->debugobj($ql);
    $schema->storage->debug(1);
      ... # do some stuff!
    my $ana = DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Analyzer->new({ querylog => $ql });
    my @queries = $ana->get_sorted_queries;

Every transaction and query executed will have a corresponding Transaction
and Query object stored in order of execution, like so:

    Query
    Query
    Transaction
    Query

This array can be retrieved with the log method.  Queries executed inside
a transaction are stored inside their Transaction object, not inside the
QueryLog directly.

See L<DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Analyzer> for options on digesting the results
of a QueryLog session.

If you wish to have the QueryLog collecting results, and the normal trace
output of SQL queries from DBIx::Class, then set C<passthrough> to 1

  $ql->passthrough(1);

=head1 BUCKETS

Sometimes you want to break your analysis down into stages.  To segregate the
queries and transactions, simply set the bucket and run some queries:

  $ql->bucket('selects');
  $schema->resultset('Foo')->find(..);
  # Some queries
  $ql->bucket('updates');
  $foo->update({ name => 'Gorch' });
  $ql->bucket('something else);
  ...

Any time a query or transaction is completed the QueryLog's current bucket
will be copied into it so that the Analyzer can later use it.  See
the get_totaled_queries method and it's optional parameter.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Create a new DBIx::Class::QueryLog.

=head2 bucket

Set the current bucket for this QueryLog.  This bucket will be copied to any
transactions or queries that finish.

=head2 time_elapsed

Returns the total time elapsed for ALL transactions and queries in this log.

=cut
sub time_elapsed {
    my $self = shift;

    my $total = 0;
    foreach my $t (@{ $self->log }) {
        $total += $t->time_elapsed;
    }

    return $total;
}

=head2 count

Returns the number of queries executed in this QueryLog

=cut
sub count {
    my $self = shift;

    my $total = 0;
    foreach my $t (@{ $self->log }) {
        $total += $t->count;
    }

    return $total;
}

=head2 reset

Reset this QueryLog by removing all transcations and queries.

=head2 add_to_log

Add this provided Transaction or Query to the log.

=head2 txn_begin

Called by DBIx::Class when a transaction is begun.

=cut

sub txn_begin {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->next::method(@_) if $self->passthrough;
    $self->current_transaction(
        $self->transaction_class()->new({
            start_time => Time::HiRes::time
        })
    );
}

=head2 txn_commit

Called by DBIx::Class when a transaction is committed.

=cut

sub txn_commit {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->next::method(@_) if $self->passthrough;
    if(defined($self->current_transaction)) {
        my $txn = $self->current_transaction;
        $txn->end_time(Time::HiRes::time);
        $txn->committed(1);
        $txn->rolledback(0);
        $self->add_to_log($txn);
        $self->current_transaction(undef);
    } else {
        warn('Unknown transaction committed.')
    }
}

=head2 txn_rollback

Called by DBIx::Class when a transaction is rolled back.

=cut

sub txn_rollback {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->next::method(@_) if $self->passthrough;
    if(defined($self->current_transaction)) {
        my $txn = $self->current_transaction;
        $txn->end_time(Time::HiRes::time);
        $txn->committed(0);
        $txn->rolledback(1);
        $self->add_to_log($txn);
        $self->current_transaction(undef);
    } else {
        warn('Unknown transaction committed.')
    }
}

=head2 query_start

Called by DBIx::Class when a query is begun.

=cut

sub query_start {
    my $self = shift;
    my $sql = shift;
    my @params = @_;

    $self->next::method($sql, @params) if $self->passthrough;
    $self->current_query(
        $self->query_class()->new({
            start_time  => Time::HiRes::time,
            sql         => $sql,
            params      => \@params,
        })
    );
}

=head2 query_end

Called by DBIx::Class when a query is completed.

=cut

sub query_end {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->next::method(@_) if $self->passthrough;
    if(defined($self->current_query)) {
        my $q = $self->current_query;
        $q->end_time(Time::HiRes::time);
        $q->bucket($self->bucket);
        if(defined($self->current_transaction)) {
            $self->current_transaction->add_to_queries($q);
        } else {
            $self->add_to_log($q)
        }
        $self->current_query(undef);
    } else {
        warn('Completed unknown query.');
    }
}

=head2 query_class

Returns the name of the class to use for storing queries, by default
C<DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Query>.  If you subclass C<DBIx::Class::QueryLog>,
you may wish to override this.  Whatever you override it to must be a
subclass of DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Query.

=head2 transaction_class

As query_class but for the class for storing transactions.  Defaults to
C<DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Transaction>.

=cut

sub query_class       { 'DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Query' }

sub transaction_class { 'DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Transaction' }
